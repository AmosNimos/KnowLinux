Computer are expected to be plug and play and their software too.
but the problemme with plug and play softwair is that they most often lack modularity and adaptibility.
as the old saying goes, if you whant somthing donne well, do it yourself.
does that mean that you have to make everithing on your own?
well that would be ideal if you could, but for the time being let's see how this philosophie can be applied.
on the fist install of a cumputer you just whant things to work, and that is to be expected but piece by piece you should
rebuild one from the ground up to fit your need.
application now day try to be everothing at the same time.
this goes against the unix/suckless mentality.
softwair should be modular.
